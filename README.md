# HYDROPREDICT
Project Overview
Groundwater is a critical resource that supports agriculture, drinking water, and industrial uses. The HYDROpredict project leverages environmental data to understand and forecast groundwater levels. By analyzing historical data such as temperature, precipitation, and groundwater levels, we aim to provide predictive insights that can aid in sustainable water management.

Objective
To explore how factors like temperature, precipitation, and seasonal changes impact groundwater levels and to create a predictive model for groundwater level trends.

Key Features

Data Cleaning and Processing: Handles missing values, standardizes data formats, and ensures data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifies key trends, visualizes data patterns, and assesses correlations between variables.

Feature Engineering: Generates new features such as monthly averages and seasonal indicators.

Machine Learning Models: Uses regression and time-series models to predict groundwater levels based on environmental factors.

Visualization: Provides clear graphs and charts to show relationships, trends, and prediction accuracy.

DATA SETS:

Groundwater Level Data: Historical data on groundwater levels.

Climate Data: Temperature and precipitation records.

Temporal Data: Date columns to analyze seasonal patterns.
